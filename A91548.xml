            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thought fit to give you an Account of the Succeſs I find in the Uſe of the Herb Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> ſent me, in Curing that ſad and deplorable Diſtemper known by the Name of <hi>Diabetes,</hi> or making abundance of Water, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153469:5"/>quickly Ends in Death, and contemns the beſt of our <hi>European</hi> Remedies.</p>
            <p>I find it an Excellent Medicine, it ſometimes gently Purgeth, and ſometimes Vomits, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neither only promotes inſenſible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, according as it finds Nature diſpoſed, and by a peculiar quality it Cures the above-named Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>I gave the Tincture of this Herb three Months together in Wine and Water to a Merchant who had lived in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and had been Baunio'd for it, and uſed all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that Countrey could afford; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no help there came over into <hi>England,</hi> and this Medicine, with God's Bleſſing, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, his immoderate Evacuation ceaſed, his Water came to be of a good Colour, and ſaltiſh taſt, his Thirſt abaited, and he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Fleſh and his Strength, tho' brought very low by the Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>An old Man who was reduced to a meer Anatomy by the prevalency of this Diſeaſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153469:5"/>and ſeveral Phyſitians had delivered their Prognoſticks, that there was no hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, becauſe their ordinary Methods of Cure had failed them, yet I gave the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of this Herb upon the Report that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had given of it, and I found it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully anſwering Expectation. I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Mr. <hi>Box</hi> at <hi>London</hi> to ſend me down what can be procured at any tollerable rates.</p>
            <p>I find admirable Succeſs by giving the Tincture in Decoctions of <hi>China Root,</hi> and ſometimes in Harts horn Drink, the Horn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt Calcined.</p>
            <p>The Learned Marchioneſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> who was an excellent Phyſitian, told me by way of Lamentation, that moſt Phyſitians of his Acquaintance did pertinatiouſly jogg on in the old Road of Vomiting, Purging, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bliſtering, Sweating, Urining; and if that would not do, they'd rather let their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients dye than preſcribe a Specifick.</p>
            <p>I alſo uſed the ſame Medicine in the Cure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153469:6"/>of a middle Aged Man, who made much more Urine that what proceeded from his liquid Aliment, ſo that all his radical Moiſture, ſeemed to be dryed up, like a Brook in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I only directed him to a temperate, moiſt and nouriſhing ſort of Dyet, that might help to incraſcate the thinneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and alſo Correct the Acrimony of the Blood, and nouriſh the macerated Habit of the Body, ſuch as Broaths made of Knuckles of Veal, and Panado's, and Caudles of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid Eggs, and Milk boiled with Water and Pearl Barley, and ſometimes with Rice. This Method, with the Tincture of this Specifick, wrought a wonderful Cure.</p>
            <p>This Diſeaſe is very dangerous in Old Men, by reaſon of the decay of the Natural Heat; and it is hard to Cure in young Men, becauſe they will ſeldom be obliged to obſerve Rules, and therefore it uſually brings into Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all their Nouriſhment running away by Urine.</p>
            <p>I lately knew a Countrey Gentleman who drank his Bottle at his Club every Night, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Months in the Year, when he was at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153469:6"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> and by that means brought himſelf into this Diſeaſe: Much Advice was taken, and many of the ordinary Shop-Medicines were uſed, but all in vain: Six hours before he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Friends deſired the Drops drawn out of this <hi>Indian</hi> Herb, but it was too late.</p>
            <p>I alſo knew a Clergy-man who drank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Tea, and whatever Friends came to viſit, he muſt drink three or four diſhes with them; at length it brought him into this Diſtemper: I gently purged him with Syrrup of <hi>Mirabolans,</hi> deſired him to quench a peice of Gold in all his drink, and gave him twenty Drops of the Tincture of this Herb, with the Extract and Spirit of the ſame in his Spoon-meat and he wonderfully eſcaped with his Life.</p>
            <p>An Eminent Phyſitian, my Neighbour, who ſuſpected himſelf going into the ſame Diſeaſe, and hearing of this Specifick, deſired a little of it, and told me he owed his Life under God to this Medicine. Theſe things I thought fit to acquaint you with, that you may tell others.</p>
